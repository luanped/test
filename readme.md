# README

* Functionality of this app is kept simple on purpose, however happy to extend with extra functionalities if required

* Not much styling is applied since my assumption was that styling isn't the main focus for this exercise. However I have tried demonstrating using BEM CSS

* I could have also written UI test for index.jsx using enzyme, however as it is such a simple view, I have omitted here, however happy to provide if requested

* Movies are clickable to print on screen more info about the movie. Similar thing can be done with people and tv, however it didn't add anything new, so did not do for this exercise

* Time spent on this exercise: ~3 hours
