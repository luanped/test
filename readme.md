# README

* Functionality of this app is kept simple on purpose, however happy to extend with extra functionalities if required

* Not much styling is applied since my assumption was that styling isn't the main focus for this exercise. However I have tried demonstrating using BEM CSS

* I could have also written UI test for index.jsx using enzyme, however as it is such a simple view, I have omitted here, however happy to provide if requested

* Time spent on this exercise: ~2 hours
